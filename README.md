# New Relic Java Instrumentation for Guidewire ClaimCenter and PolicyCenter

Instrumentation for Guidewire applications, including ClaimCenter and PolicyCenter.

## Installation

1. Obtain the latest release from this repository.
1. Extract the release into a local directory.
1. Transfer the extension JAR file to the target server
1. Copy the extension JAR file into the agent's `extensions` directory (relative to the directory containing the `newrelic.jar` file).
    *Note:* Create the `extensions` directory if it does not exist.
1. Restart your JVM
1. After the app has reloaded, generate traffic against your app that will trigger transactions that you expect to see.
